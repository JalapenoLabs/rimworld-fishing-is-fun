# Rimworld Fishing Is Fun

This is a mod designed for Rimworld, 1.6 and the Odyssey DLC.

This is intended to make the Odyssey DLCâ€™s fishing activity count as recreation and grant a mood buff after a long fishing session.

# Features:
1. Recreation Need Gain: While the pawn is actively fishing, their recreation (joy) need increases steadily (similar to playing chess or other joy activities).
2. Mood Buff: If the pawn spent at least 1 in-game hour (2,500 ticks) fishing continuously, they receive a +3 "Pleasant Fishing Trip" mood thought lasting 6 hours.
