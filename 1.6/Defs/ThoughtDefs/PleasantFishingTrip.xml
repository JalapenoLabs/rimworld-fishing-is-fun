    <!-- ~6 in-game hours. In RimWorld, time durations are set in days;
    6 hours is 0.25 days (since 1 day = 24 hours).
    This will translate to 15,000 ticks (as 1 hour = 2,500 ticks). -->

    <!-- a pawn can have only one instance of this thought at a time.
    This ensures the buff refreshes its duration on subsequent fishing trips
    instead of stacking multiple moodlets.
    With stackLimit=1, if the pawn already has the “pleasant fishing trip” thought,
    gaining it again will reset the timer rather than create a second stack. -->
