  <!-- ~6 in-game hours. In RimWorld, time durations are set in days;
   6 hours is 0.25 days (since 1 day = 24 hours).
   This will translate to 15,000 ticks (as 1 hour = 2,500 ticks). -->
  <durationDays>0.25</durationDays>
  <!-- a pawn can have only one instance of this thought at a time.
   This ensures the buff refreshes its duration on subsequent fishing trips
   instead of stacking multiple moodlets.
   With stackLimit=1, if the pawn already has the “pleasant fishing trip” thought,
   gaining it again will reset the timer rather than create a second stack. -->
  <stackLimit>1</stackLimit>
  <!-- (a standard memory thought) since this is a transient mood boost. -->
